Aquatic Animal Disease Predictor is a  machine learning web application developed using Python, Flask, pandas, and scikit-learn. It enables users—especially aquaculture farmers, students, and researchers—to easily diagnose common diseases in fish or prawns based on user-selected symptoms. The system is trained on a custom 200-entry dataset containing aquatic animal types, symptoms, corresponding diseases, cures, and recommended medicines. When a user selects an animal and a symptom from a dynamic dropdown menu, the model predicts the most likely disease using a Decision Tree Classifier and instantly displays the appropriate cure and medication. The app features a visually engaging underwater theme, complete with animated fish and prawn graphics, and runs entirely locally using IDLE or any Python environment without needing cloud deployment. This project demonstrates the practical integration of machine learning with web development and serves as an educational tool or a useful prototype for real-world aquaculture diagnostics.
